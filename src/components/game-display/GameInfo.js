        Explore incredible places far from the Mushroom Kingdom as you join
        Mario and his new ally Cappy on a massive, globe-trotting 3D adventure.

        This Starter Pack includes the Super Mario Odyssey™ game for the
        Nintendo Switch™ system and a Traveler’s Guide book.

        Use amazing new abilities—like the power to capture and control objects,
        animals, and enemies—to collect Power Moons so you can power up the
        Odyssey airship and save Princess Peach from Bowser's wedding plans!

        Thanks to heroic, hat-shaped Cappy, Mario's got new moves that'll make
        you rethink his traditional run-and-jump gameplay—like cap jump, cap
        throw, and capture. Use captured cohorts such as enemies, objects, and
        animals to progress through the game and uncover loads of hidden
        collectibles. And if you feel like playing with a friend, just pass them
        a Joy-Con™ controller! Player 1 controls Mario while Player 2 controls
        Cappy. This sandbox-style 3D Mario adventure—the first since 1996's
        beloved Super Mario 64™ and 2002's Nintendo GameCube™ classic Super
        Mario Sunshine™—is packed with secrets and surprises, plus exciting new
        kingdoms to explore.
